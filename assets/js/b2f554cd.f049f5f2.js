Her hair is often down and she doesn\u2019t stray from eye contact. Perhaps it\u2019s her baggy clothes that show composure though not rigidity \u2014 or perhaps it\u2019s because she dances for a UC San Diego group on the side of her academics \u2014 but there is an air of self-assuredness around Macaulay. \\n\\nMacaulay, a senior in Sixth College, joined the Other People Magazine this year. She\u2019s still working out the small kinks \u2014 like figuring out their Google Drive. But otherwise, some might think that she\u2019s been a part of the team for a longer while. \\n\\nAlongside Library Walk, [Other People Magazine](https://otherpeoplesd.com/) members sometimes appear to promote their works and get funding. On Valentine\u2019s Day, Macaulay was at a stand to sell realistic long-stemmed red roses with quotes from esteemed writers or poets. She was selling them for a couple of bucks a pop, to help their magazine with funds. This is because the OPM declares itself to be the first completely student-run creative literary magazine that accepts art and literature on UCSD grounds. Their independence, though, means they have to be self-sufficient. \\n\\nA few days before Valentine\u2019s, the magazine had its Collection No. 5 \u201cEclipse\u201d launch party and an Open Mic Night, too \u2014 an intimate opportunity for members to be able to share their works. Sometime later, some of the OPM\u2019s works were featured in an art gallery on Library Walk alongside other organizations to showcase UCSD\u2019s art community. \\n\\nIt\u2019s not surprising to say that Other People Magazine has paved its way to be a ubiquitous presence on campus \u2014 especially with its intriguing black-and-white Venn Diagram logo that emphasizes \u201cThe People\u201d aspect of it and the unified celebration of both art and technology.\\n\\nBut, it\u2019s still a relatively young club. Macaulay dubs OPM \u201ca COVID baby,\u201d a magazine that kicked off with its first issue in the summer of 2020 amidst uncertainty and undeniable passion from Literature/Writing majors. OPM [isn\u2019t the first creative magazine](https://otherpeoplesd.com/uc-magazines) on campus either. They even coexist with a magazine called \u201cKaleidoscoped,\u201d brought forward by MFA and graduate students in 2021 as well as others, such as Revellations and [Antifragile Zine](https://ucsdguardian.org/2023/03/12/from-dreams-to-realities-the-antifragile-zine/). OPM is an undergraduate gem that emphasizes its relaxed atmosphere (though they do take submissions from those who have graduated from UCSD as well).\\n\\n\u201cI\u2019ve always loved to write,\u201d Macaulay said. \u201cAnd I really like to edit. I was just like \u2026 UCSD is such a STEM school, you know? And I was just looking for a creative outlet. I was going to apply for The Guardian. I was going to apply for the MQ. I wasn\u2019t really sure where to go. But then, I heard of Other People through a friend. It reminded me of my high school magazine, which was called the \u2018Pen of Iron.\u2019\u201d\\n\\nMacaulay liked the lax ambiance and quickly found a place to submit her application on their website for staff positions. The website also offers places to submit work, but she specifically wanted to join the team. She applied to be an editor and content writer, where she uploaded her own piece and edited a work respectively for consideration. The magazine touched bases with her in a week or so. She got both positions. \\n\\nThe magazine has been a safe haven for Macaulay \u2014 a home away from STEM just for a bit (unless the design team is involved to help program a piece for experimental purposes). She first underwent an editing workshop to learn how to edit pieces and catch any unintentional errors. The magazine also holds biweekly all-staff meetings and meetings for content writers and the design team. \\n\\nMacaulay is one of about seven to ten other editors. The creative editors are responsible for workshopping for structure and form, while copy editors are more akin to those in journalism.\\n\\n\u201cOur main thing is: I\u2019m here to edit your piece but I\u2019m not here to make it something it\u2019s not,\u201d she said.\\n\\nThe revision process begins when Macaulay reads anonymous pieces then scores them on a scale from 1 to 4. Afterward, votes go in amongst editors to see to it that the work gets published or not. If she wishes to accept a piece, she contacts the writer and conducts a collaborative process of about three meetings with them to proceed in the publishing process.\\n\\nShe strives to make the authors comfortable. Within her own team, sometimes weeks don\u2019t look perfect and members miss deadlines. But members communicate amongst each other without being brusque with one another.\\n\\n\u201cWe get people [for OPM] who just like to write and edit,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re just passionate about it. I think our hearts are in the right place. We just want to create a magazine that\u2019s beautiful and \u2026 give the humanities kids somewhere to go, and a place to have their voice heard. No one\u2019s in here for the ego \u2026 There\u2019s no person in charge who\u2019s like \u2018hey, hey hey.\u2019\u201d\\n\\nRecently, however, she dropped the content writer role to just be an editor. And the breath of relief was perhaps that there was no penalization or disapproval from her team. Nina Gerardi, a junior from John Muir College and co-editor-in-chief along with senior Zoe Wong, did send her writing exercises and did check-ins with her, but Macaulay couldn\u2019t put pen to paper. So, she didn\u2019t force it.\\n\\nTo Macaulay, academic assignments were one thing and executing something creative was something else. But doing something creative by a deadline was a different playing field she hadn\u2019t found footing in yet. The intrinsic motivation wasn\u2019t kicking in; her poems either didn\u2019t connect to her life now or if they did, she wasn\u2019t certain she wanted people to look at that aspect of her. \\n\\nThe magazine currently gets submissions numbering in the 80s, sometimes 100, with works ranging from experimental poetry to nonfiction. The content is crucial \u2014 the team gets a plethora of poetry and the poems in general are more easily formattable to both online and print \u2014  but there is also a capped number of pieces. Additionally, submissions that are too long or not thematically aligned with the issues will go online instead of in print.\\n\\nThe main goal for the magazine is to address works for the website and works for the print magazine. For \u201cEclipse\u201d, they received about 40 to 50 submissions. \\n\\nGerardi, took a management course on psychological safety where she concluded that everyone should feel happy in the team, included, and not enmeshed in conflict. When one is a bit quiet or distant, she asks them how they are doing. With Macaulay, she offered grace during her writing block.\\n\\nIndeed, psychological safety is important for an individual to feel at peace at work. As long as one means well, asking questions and saying or doing things not leading to negative consequences are important measures in feeling safe.\\n\\nProfessor Amy C. Edmonson of Harvard Business School coined the term \u201cpsychological safety,\u201d in which one\u2019s security is dependent on how permissible it is to make mistakes, how okay it is for difficult topics to be approached, how much people are willing to help one another, and to what extent one is welcomed for this. For the leader, seeing work as learning problems is important in addition to asking questions.\\n\\nIn OPM, there is a Cerberus-like dynamic with three figures heading the magazine. Wong and Gerardi are the editors-in-chief with Caroline Tjoe as the design director.\\n\\nGerardi wears a big smile and her hair in a ponytail. She laughed as she recalled someone mistaking her for a senior in her sophomore year. She gives off a sense of composure but she, like Macaulay, joined not too long ago. She joined last year in Winter Quarter, describing herself as someone who\u2019s always been a writer. \\n\\nShe decided to be an editor-in-chief because others believed she was detail-oriented and she believed them. Gerardi aimed to make the magazine larger and much more social \u2014 as both an organization and a professional production.  After all, the magazine has about 30 members, but the team size isn\u2019t capped yet; she expressed her desire to see the team grow further.\\n\\nBut Gerardi, an aspiring author post-graduation, initially joined as an editor to fine-tune her writing skills. \\n\\n\u201cThe Other People Magazine is a tight-knit community,\u201d she explained.  \u201cWe have connections to the department which made the Seattle conference we went to possible. We have psychological safety. We\u2019re all artists here and we\u2019re all being vulnerable. I want members to feel safe to share. We became a family over the years because we were all open to each other.\u201d\\n\\nIn fact, alumnus Kevin Jang joined OPM in 2021; he grew as a website and newsletter producer as well as a magazine layout designer. He graduated in the fall but is still a present member as a webmaster, which is telling of what the environment means to him.\\n\\nHe does much of the design, particularly experimental pieces, having collaborated with a fellow student to create an animated piece that writes itself called \u201c[missed connections](https://otherpeoplesd.com/missed-connections).\u201d Every written piece is accompanied by a drawing or photography submissions so the visual aspect of the OPM magazine is particularly vital. Everything from the logo to the minimalistic feel of the website is telling of how intertwined the work is to the visual nature of the pieces.\\n\\nIn that particular prose poetry piece, the unknown writer is typing to the audience with every missed beat or deleted sentence detailed on the screen. The audience can sense the backtracking and the pensive state of the author because of the pauses in thinking \u2014 everything that would not be visible if the work were written out as a normal piece. \\n\\nJang expresses his excitement for Collection NO. 6, set to come out for the summer. He wrote a program for a choose-your-own-adventure story that he said features \u201cover 75 routes and amusing metacommentary\u201d with a top-secret section, which will again test his inclination to head into experimental prose and poetry waters.\\n\\nEvery year, the magazine strives to publish an issue (but often two) annually. The names for the issues were a tricky process with deliberation on names like \u201cLiminal\u201d and \u201cDive,\u201d all very minimalistic as well. They decided on the name \u201cLiminal,\u201d a theme birthed from the very nature of the submissions from the students themselves.\\n\\nCurrently, Macaulay is not interested in submitting pieces but she might consider posting a piece of interest after graduation or continuing as a part of the team like Jang post-graduation. \\n\\n\u201c[OPM] is like a flower that\u2019s blooming,\u201d Macaulay said. \u201cAnd the people who are watering it are very pure of heart. And that makes it very special.\u201d"},{"id":"opm-triton-debut","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/opm-triton-debut","editUrl":"https://github.com/Other-People-UCSD/docs/tree/main/blog/2020-10-27-the-triton-debut/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2020-10-27-the-triton-debut/index.md","title":"New Literature Magazine at UCSD fosters Student Expression","description":"This article is extracted from The Triton, University of California, San Diego\'s independent student newsletter.","date":"2020-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 27, 2020","tags":[{"label":"Featured","permalink":"/blog/tags/featured"}],"readingTime":2.88,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Amanda Gonzalez","title":"Staff Writer at The Triton","url":"https://triton.news/author/agonzalez/"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"opm-triton-debut","title":"New Literature Magazine at UCSD fosters Student Expression","authors":{"name":"Amanda Gonzalez","title":"Staff Writer at The Triton","url":"https://triton.news/author/agonzalez/"},"tags":["Featured"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Other People Magazine: No Tortured Artists Here, a Home for any \u201cOthered\u201d","permalink":"/blog/opm-guardian-feature"}},"content":":::note\\n\\nThis article is extracted from [The Triton](https://triton.news/2020/10/new-literature-magazine-at-ucsd-fosters-student-expression/), University of California, San Diego\'s independent student newsletter.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nFounded in November 2019, [Other People Magazine](https://www.otherpeoplesd.com/) is the first student-run literary magazine at UC San Diego, providing a creative outlet for students and alumni. The first issue, released on July 31, included fiction and nonfiction pieces, poems, and paintings among other works. \\n\\nWhile the magazine was started by Literature Writing majors, Other People encourages students of all disciplines to participate. \\n\\nEditors-in-Chief Montanna Harling and Nicole Lopez founded Other People after realizing there was a lack of creative platforms for students. \u201cWe wanted to develop an inclusive platform that brings together creative students and encourages literary and artistic expression on our predominantly STEM-focused campus,\u201d said Harling. \u201cMy fellow co-founders and I began this magazine and club in hopes of crafting a community where students who are passionate about the arts can come together, hone and express their talents, and immerse themselves in an organization of like-minded individuals.\u201d\\n\\nThe new magazine aims to showcase the artistic talent and creativity among UCSD\u2019s student body. Caitlyn Vilar, who contributed to Other People\u2019s first issue, stated, \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to highlight the creative works of students and help them gain exposure especially since UCSD has never really had an outlet like this for writers\u2026 We have competitions that writers can enter, but nothing that gives a lot of writers opportunities to be published.\u201d\\n\\nOther People Magazine currently accepts prose, poetry, photography, and other forms of visual art from current undergraduates and graduate students as well as UCSD alumni who graduated within the last 3 years. \\n\\nWith the stress of the classes, students can find relief through artistic expression. \u201cCreative expression is important for college students because it helps us define ourselves, expand our way of thinking, and view the world through a unique lens,\u201d said Harling. \u201cThrough creativity, we are able to capture the things in this world that seem intangible\u2013feelings, memories, dreams, experiences\u2013and share those meaningful glimpses of life with others.\u201d\\n\\nBelow are four highlights for the first issue of \u201cOther People\u201d\u2026\\n\\n> <em>\u201cA hand reaching.
